- 👋 Hi, I’m @IndiaJean-Jacques

- 👀 I’m interested in blockchain technology and machine learning neural networks
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, typescript and how to use jQuery, TensorFlow, and SciKit in machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects - open to learning more
- 📫 How to reach me - LinkedIn!!

I am a hard working, motivated and team-spirited individual who loves coding in my spare time. I have a penchant for continuous improvement evidenced in my recent achievement of the 2021 ICE QUEST Technician Scholarship. I am currently a Civil Engineering (Highways) Apprentice at WSP skilled in AutoCAD and Microsoft Office applications.

I have worked on a range of projects from large scale infrastructure to local authorities, bids, performance reporting and financial reporting. This has afforded me immense capacities for commercial awareness and report writing evident in my Excel proficiency and attention to detail in tasks and writing.

When I can, I find ways to develop my coding skills and proficiencies. I am particularly skilled in Python. Recently, I have relatively good capability in HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the basics of SQL.

I am always up for a challenge and continue to push myself to take on new exciting roles illustrated by my involvement in various initiatives promoting sustainability, Lean, and early career professional growth. l also took on the role of Apprentice-Technician champion for the ICE's London Graduate and Student committee.

As a registered STEM ambassador, I am also passionate about giving back through my volunteering and encouraging more women and girls into STEM careers.
